        <section>
            <h2> Introduction </h2>
            <p>
                This is a simple pandemic model using a geometric serie.
                The population of sick people grows according to an initial growth rate. 
                In addition, there are two ways of diagnosing sick people: a low fidelity test
                and a high fidelity test.
                Once a sick person is diagnosed, it is assumed to be put in quarantine, and cannot 
                infect new persons. 
                The performance of the tests are characterized by two parameters: compliance and success rate. 
                The compliance corresponds to the proportion of sick people that can be tested. 
                The success rate defines the proportion of tested people that can be diagnosed correctly.
                One can define a test policy by choosing those two parameters and influence the growth rate of the pandemic.

            <h2>Play around with the model!</h2>

            <p>
            The plot illustrates the effective growth rate when implementing certain test policy.
            For a given compliance and success rate of the low fidelity test, the plot illustrates
            whether the growth rate is controlled. 
            The green region indicates a controlled growth rate (< 1) while the red region indicates
            an uncontrolled growth rate (> 1).
            </p>

            <p>
                The slider allows to control the compliance of the high fidelity test whose
                success rate is 0.99.
                As we increase the compliance of the high fidelity test we see that the region where
                the growth rate is controlled increases.
                After roughly 20% of compliance, the whole design space is green, meaning that
                no low fidelity testing is required to control the spread of the pandemic.
