            <h2> Introduction </h2>
            <p>
                This is a simple disease propagation model using a geometric serie.
                The population of sick people grows according to an initial growth rate. 
                In addition, there are two ways of diagnosing sick people: a low fidelity test
                and a high fidelity test.
                Once a sick person is diagnosed, it is assumed to be put in quarantine, and cannot 
                infect a new person. 
                The performance of the tests are characterized by two parameters: compliance and success rate. 
                The compliance corresponds to the proportion of sick people that can be tested. 
                The success rate defines the proportion of tested people that can be diagnosed correctly.
                The value of those two parameters influences the effective growth rate of the pandemic.
                This example serves the purpose of illustrating that low fidelity testing can have a significant effect on controlling
                the growth rate.

            <h2>Disclaimer</h2>

            <p>  
                This is a toy model using a geometric serie, it is not based on any scientific evidence but purely intuition and we have no expertise in epidemic modeling.

            <h2>Play with the model</h2>

            <p>
            For a given compliance and success rate of the low fidelity test, the plot illustrates
            whether the growth rate is controlled or not. 
            The green region indicates a controlled growth rate (< 1) while the red region indicates
            an uncontrolled growth rate (> 1).
            </p>

            <p>
                The slider allows to control the compliance of the high fidelity test whose
                success rate is 0.99.
                As the compliance of the high fidelity test increases we see that the region where
                the growth rate is controlled becomes larger.
                After roughly 20% of compliance, the whole design space is green, meaning that
                no low fidelity testing is required to control the spread of the pandemic.
                On the other hand, we can see that even with very little high fidelity testing, the growth rate can be controlled with a reasonable amount of low fidelity testing.

            <h2>Mathematical Model</h2>
            <p>
                To model the growth of the epidemic we used a geometric serie. 
                Let \( s_t \) be the number of sick people at a given day \( t \). 
                The number of sick people the next day is given by:
                \[
                s_{t+1} = g s_t
                \]
                where \( g \) is the initial growth rate of the disease. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We supposed that two tests are possible: a high fidelity test and a low fidelity test.
                They are characterized by two numbers each: \( \lambda_\text{lo}, \beta_\text{lo}, \lambda_\text{hi}, \beta_\text{hi} \).
                The compliance, \(\lambda_\text{x} \), corresponds to the proportion of the sick people that can be tested. 
                The success rate, \(\beta_{x} \), corresponds to the proportion of tested people that are diagnosed correctly. 
                We assume that each day, a group of patient is tested using the high fidelity test first, and then another group of patient is tested using the low fidelity test.
                Once a patient has been diagnosed, he is assumed to be quarantined and cannot contribute to the propagation of the disease anymore.
                Given these assumptions we can update the growth model of the disease as follows:
                \[
                s_{t+1} = (1 - \lambda_\text{hi} \beta_\text{hi} - \lambda_\text{lo} \beta_\text{lo} (1 - \lambda_{hi})) g s_t
                \] 
                We say that the growth of the disease is controlled when the effective growth rate is smaller than 1 i.e. when more people are diagnosed than people getting sick.
                The equation of the boundary between the red and green zone is then given by:
                \[
                    (1 - \lambda_\text{hi} \beta_\text{hi} - \lambda_\text{lo} \beta_\text{lo} (1 - \lambda_{hi})) \leq 1
                \]
